# Decision Tree

### PURPOSE:
* To create a general purpose decison tree classifier that is trained using the [ID3 algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID3_algorithm) to maximize gain when splitting.

### HOW IT WORKS:
The general purpose decision tree is implemented as a package in the DecisionTree folder.

The proj3.py file is an example usage of the DecisionTree package.  It trains using a large set of data about adults (the adult.data file) and then can classify data points into the income brackets "<=50K" and ">50K"


### HOW TO RUN:
````./proj3.py````
